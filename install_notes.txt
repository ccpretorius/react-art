styled components
npm install styled-components

Inside AuthInputs.jsx:
import { styled } from 'styled-components'

styled.div``  => this is a js object with elements accessible on it attached to a Tagged Template. The Tagged template is like a function that receives this Template literal as an input.
So you can copy the styles from the index.css file in our tutorial into this Template literals here:

styled.div`
display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
`
You can write standard css code here, no camelCase or jsx notation.

This component will automatically receives a div that will have these styles applied to it

This should now be stored inside a new constant variable:

const ControlContainer = styled.div`
display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
`

This can now be used to replace <div clasName="control"></div> with
<ControlContainer>
</ControlContainer>

All props in the ternary conditional operator would be carried forward
Remember you cannot use the logical AND (&&) operator by evaluating the left-hand expression and, if it is truthy, returning the right-hand expression e.g {email && do something}
